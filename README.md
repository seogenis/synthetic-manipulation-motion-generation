# NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint: Synthetic Manipulation Motion Generation for Robotics

The NVIDIA Isaac GR00T blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is the ideal place to start. This is a reference workflow for creating exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion trajectories for robot manipulation from a small number of human demonstrations, built on [NVIDIA Omniverse™](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim) and [NVIDIA Cosmos™](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/cosmos/).

# Deploy On Local Workstation

## Prerequisites
**Requirements for local deployment:**
* Ubuntu 22.04 Operating System
* NVIDIA GPU (GeForce RTX 4080 with 32GB RAM and 16GB VRAM or higher)
  * [See Isaac Sim Requirements with Isaac Lab VRAM note](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/requirements.html)
* [NVIDIA GPU Driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/) (recommended version 535.129.03)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
* [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit) (minimum version 1.17.0)

**Requirements for NVIDIA Cosmos:**
* NVIDIA GPU (H100 or higher) with 80GB of VRAM.
  * NVIDIA H100 GPU is available on AWS in a P5 EC2 instance, GCP in a A3 machine type VM and Azure in a ND H100 v5 series VM
* Visit the [Cosmos Hugging Face Model](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Transfer1-7B) for specific details
>[!NOTE]
NVIDIA Cosmos must be run on a node separate from the Isaac Lab simulation due to differing hardware requirements.

## Launch a Jupyter Notebook

Steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local workstation and navigate to this repository.

       git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse-blueprints/synthetic-manipulation-motion-generation.git
       cd synthetic-manipulation-motion-generation

2. Enable X11 forwarding for a local workstation user.

       xhost +local:

3. Deploy the Jupyter Notebook with the Blueprint container.

       docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
       
4. Access the Jupyter Notebook from a browser at http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/generate_dataset.ipynb.

5. Follow the instructions inside of the Jupyter Notebook.

6. Run the command below to stop the Jupyter Notebook and end the demo.

       docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down

>[!NOTE]
The Blueprint container includes a pre-installed version of Isaac Lab 2.0.2 and Isaac Sim 4.5.0.
